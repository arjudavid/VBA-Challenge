# VBA Challenge

In this challenge I will create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

   - The ticker symbol
   - Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
   - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
   - The total stock volume of the stock.

Also I will be adding functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"; as well as, making the appropriate adjustments to the script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.

## Summary

You'll find a VBA script which contains the code that loops through all worksheets in the excel file. The code has comments giving a brief explanation on what's happening.

You'll find the Excel file which should have the macro for the code, the results of the looped data and those results should be highlihted with conditional formatting.

At last there should be 4 screenshots. Each screenshot should contain a different sheet result for each quarter.
